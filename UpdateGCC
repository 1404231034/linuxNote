Here is somethings about update gcc on linux platform.

1.We can use this command get the Install Pack of gcc.

$ wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gcc/gcc-6.1.0/gcc-6.1.0.tar.bz2
(you also can get gcc from http://ftp.tsukuba.wide.ad.jp/software/gcc/releases/
in this link,all the version of gcc,but the speed is slow)

and then we need uncompress the install pack
use this command:tar â€“xzf  gcc-8.2.0.tar.gz(you need change the name to your)

comment:if your install pack is not end of '.tar.gz',please use other command to uncompress;
	there are so many command about uncompress flies in another aarticle.

2.please enter into the uncompress folder and use this script
	then will download,config,install denpendent librarise.
	help us save time

./contrib/download_prerequisites

comment:you need connect the internet 


3,please create a new folder use save the file from compile

 you need root authority to create the folder

command :mkdir gcc-build-6.1.0

then enter into it: cd gcc-build-6.1.0


4.use this script build Makefile 

../configure -enable-checking=release -enable-languages=c,c++ -disable-multilib

5.compile

command:make

this step will use so long time ,you can see a movie and then goback
if you need fast,please use :make -j4,but this way,maybe,you could get failure

command:ls /usr/local/bin | grep gcc
this command for grep the file of install

6.then ,you need restart your computer or use the command:init 6
